Music has always been my solace, my sanctuary of expression. As a passionate singer, I channel emotions, stories, and dreams through the power of song. When I'm not immersed in lines of code or out exploring the world, you'll often find me on stage, pouring my heart into soulful melodies and exhilarating performances.
