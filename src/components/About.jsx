            I am a 23-year-old frontend developer who graduated from St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai. I discovered my passion for web development during my job hunt and received a lot of help from friends while self-learning. I love working on web design. Besides coding, I enjoy singing and being on stage. Music has always been a significant part of my life. I also love traveling with my friends and family.  I am still learning  a lot of things. I love finding and trying new things out.
